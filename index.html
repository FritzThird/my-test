  <h1>Hello, and welcome.</h1>
  <p>My name is Max, and I'm a space explorer. I love to travel across the galaxy and discover new planets, stars, and aliens. Here you'll find some of my stories and adventures, as well as some photos and videos of the amazing things I've seen. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.</p>
  <p>Let me tell you about the time I met a friendly alien on a planet called Zork. Zork is a small, green world with purple skies and orange clouds. It has two moons and three suns, which make it very bright and warm. I landed my spaceship on a grassy field and decided to explore the surroundings.</p>
  <p>As I was walking, I saw a strange creature coming towards me. It looked like a giant, furry ball with six legs, four eyes, and two antennae. It was making a loud, squeaky noise that sounded like "Zee-zee-zee". I was a bit scared, but also curious. I wondered if it was friendly or hostile.</p>
  <p>I decided to greet it and see what would happen. I said, "Hello, I'm Max. I come from Earth. Do you understand me?" The creature stopped and tilted its head. It looked at me with its four eyes and said, "Zee-zee-zee". Then it smiled and wagged its antennae. I guessed that it was friendly and happy to see me.</p>
  <p>I smiled back and said, "Nice to meet you. What's your name?" The creature said, "Zee-zee-zee". I realized that it was its name, or at least the only word it could say. I said, "Zee-zee-zee, that's a nice name. Do you live here?" Zee-zee-zee nodded and said, "Zee-zee-zee". Then it gestured with its legs and invited me to follow it.</p>
  <p>I followed Zee-zee-zee to its home, which was a large, round hut made of sticks and leaves. Inside, there were more creatures like Zee-zee-zee, of different sizes and colors. They all greeted me with "Zee-zee-zee" and smiled and wagged their antennae. I felt like I had made new friends.</p>
